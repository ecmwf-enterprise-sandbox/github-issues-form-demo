# GitHub Issues Form Demo

GitHub has a new-ish feature (released a couple of years ago), in open beta for open source
repos, which lets us create templates for GitHub Issues using web forms.

There's a closed beta for private/internal repos which for whatever reason hasn't yet been opened
up: https://github.com/community/community/discussions/4264

This repo demos how a GitHub Issues form could look.
